# Star-Formation-and-Evolution

[Gregory Herczeg](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/faculty/gregory-j-herczeg) whose nick name is 'Greg', is associate director of science at Kavli 
Institute for Astrophysics and Astronomy (KIAA) at Peking University (PKU). He taught class star formation and evolution at autumn 2019 
for first year post-graduate students and I am one of them. The homework he gave us is very helpful for understanding physical process in 
stars. It is a pity that he will not teach this class for a few years but I hope the tradition of doing homework will last forever.
